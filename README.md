## Stack 
This app was built using `React-Redux` and UI development framework was `Semantic ui`.

### Project explanation 

The Project was built using React-Redux architecture, in case of storing the `likes` for the images was done using redux store, single state manager. Semantic Ui used for this responsive web app that fit for mobile view. Taken care of mobile first design.
Used axios to load the insta.json file to the app. At first I tired directly with the provided  api but i faced CROS related issues.

Implemented the in place Edit/update info functionality for user experience.
Taken care of basic validation like if post has no comments then disabled `show comments` button will be shown.

The given data was blended to fit the app's functionality, added comments
The `like button` has implantation like medium's clap button functionality unlike Instagram like.

Had a great time working in this project.
